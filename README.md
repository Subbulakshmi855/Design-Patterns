DESIGN PATTERNS USE CASES 

Overview

This repository contains various examples demonstrating different design patterns in Java. Each example includes a specific use case to illustrate the application of the pattern.

Exercise 1: Design Pattern Use Cases

1. BEHAVIORAL PATTERNS

   •	Restaurant Service Workflow - Demonstrates the TEMPLATE PATTERN in behavioural design pattern.

   •	Study Session State Pattern - Demonstrates the STATE PATTERN for modeling a study session transitioning through different states.

2. CREATIONAL PATTERNS

   •	Customizable Pizza - Demonstrates the BUILDER PATTERN for constructing customizable pizzas.

   •	Database Connection - Demonstrates the SINGLETON PATTERN to manage a database connection.

3. STRUCTURAL PATTERNS

   •	City Transportation System - Demonstrates the BRIDGE PATTERN to manage various modes of transportation (Bus, Train, Flight) between cities.

   •	Book Management System - Demonstrates the DECORATOR PATTERN to enhance book objects with additional features.


Exercise 2: VIRTUAL CLASSROOM MANAGER

   A terminal-based application for managing virtual classrooms, demonstrating multiple design patterns.

Files:

   •	Main.java: Application entry point.

   •	models/*, services/*, exceptions/*, utils/*: Various classes implementing the functionality.


Prerequisites:

   •	Java Development Kit (JDK) 8 or later.


This repository provides practical examples of various design patterns to help understand their usage and implementation in Java.
