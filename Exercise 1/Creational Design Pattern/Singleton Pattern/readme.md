DATABASE CONNECTION 

Overview
This use case demonstrates the Singleton Pattern using a database connection example in Java. The Singleton Pattern is particularly useful when you need to control access to a resource that should only be initialized once. This example illustrates how to manage a database connection using the Singleton Pattern to ensure that only one connection instance is created.
